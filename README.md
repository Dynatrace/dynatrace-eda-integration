This is an example setup of [Red Hat Event-Driven Ansible](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/platform-modules/automations/workflows/actions/red-hat/redhat-even-driven-ansible).

It uses the [dt-webhook](https://github.com/Dynatrace/Dynatrace-EventDrivenAnsible) as a source in the rulebook to trigger the problem remediation playbooks.
